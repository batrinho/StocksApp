# StocksApp
This is my pet-project, called **StocksApp**, which is an intuitive iOS App where you can see stock companies and their prices, explore with search, view price charts, and like your favorite stocks effortlessly.
____
#### Frameworks and techniques used in this project: ####
* The project was written according to **Model-View-Presenter(MVP)** architecture.
* Recent searches, favorite stocks can be locally saved by **CoreData**.
* Three different NetworkingService classes were written, where I used **Grand Central Dispatch, Async/Await**, and **Operation** frameworks.
* Embedded an external library, **DGCharts**, using **CocoaPods**, to show price charts.
* Followed **Dependency Injection** principle, for better testing.
* Created a custom, movable **BubbleView** that shows the price and the date for the selected price in the chart.
* Learned a lot about **Swift** and **iOS development**.
